# Security Measures Implemented

This document details the security measures implemented in the Secure Email Application to protect user data, ensure authentication, and mitigate common vulnerabilities.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0 with Google API**: The application uses Google OAuth 2.0 for Gmail API access, leveraging Google's secure authentication mechanism. Refresh tokens are stored securely and used to obtain access tokens, ensuring users authenticate with their Google accounts.
- **JWT Token**: A custom JWT-based authentication system is implemented for frontend-backend communication. Tokens are stored in `localStorage` and included in API requests via the `Authorization` header.
- **Role-Based Access**: The `/emails` endpoint is protected, requiring a valid token to access email data, ensuring only authenticated users can retrieve their emails.

## 2. Data Protection
- **HTTPS**: The application assumes deployment over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit (recommended for production).
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data such as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and `MONGO_URI` are stored in `.env` files and excluded from version control (`.gitignore`d).
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storage in MongoDB, preventing plaintext storage.

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Frontend Validation**: Input fields (e.g., email, password) in the login/register form include basic validation (e.g., `required` attribute) to prevent empty submissions.
- **Backend Validation**: The backend validates incoming requests (e.g., email format, token presence) to prevent injection attacks.

## 4. Secure API Endpoints
- **CORS Configuration**: The FastAPI backend uses `CORSMiddleware` to restrict origins to `http://localhost:3000`, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- **Error Handling**: API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 401 for unauthorized, 500 for internal errors) to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## 5. Database Security
- **MongoDB Encryption**: Sensitive fields (e.g., hashed passwords) are stored in MongoDB, with the connection string secured via environment variables.
- **No Sensitive Data Exposure**: The database schema avoids storing unencrypted personal data beyond what is necessary.

## 6. Future Recommendations
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for additional security in form submissions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **SSL/TLS**: Enforce SSL/TLS in production to encrypt all communications.
- **Audit Logs**: Add logging of critical actions (e.g., login, email access) for monitoring.

These measures ensure a secure environment for handling email data, though ongoing updates and penetration testing are recommended to address emerging threats.
